# C Programming Practice Programs (1–135...)

## Introduction

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of **C programming practice questions** that I have solved while preparing for my **C Programming examination**.  

The programs cover concepts ranging from **basic syntax** to **advanced topics** such as **structures, unions, dynamic memory allocation, file handling, and pointers**.

⚠️ **Note:**  
This repository **does NOT contain Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems**.  

All questions focus strictly on **fundamental C programming concepts**.
I am sharing this collection so that **other students can also practice, revise, and prepare effectively for exams, viva, and practical assessments**.

## What This Repository Contains

- `questions.txt`  
  → Contains the **complete list of C programming questions** with program numbers (Program 1 to Program 135).

- Individual C source files  
  → Each program is saved separately using the format:  
  **`program_no.c`**  
  (Example: `program_25.c`, `program_66.c`, etc.)
